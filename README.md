This is a plugin for Qmmp (1.6.0 or greater) which supports SunVox file.

Based on [SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox) (A powerful modular synthesizer and pattern-based sequencer (tracker)).

The following packages are required, including development headers,
which some vendors split into separate packages:

- SunVox
- qt4 for qmmp 0.x
- qt5 for qmmp 1.x
- qt6 for qmmp 2.x

To build, run Qt's qmake:

If you are building for qmmp 0.x, run: <br/>
`$ qmake-qt4` <br/>
If you are building for qmmp 1.x, run: <br/>
`$ qmake-qt5` <br/>
And if you are building for qmmp 2.x, run: <br/>
`$ qmake-qt6` <br/>

Then build with make: <br/>
`$ make`

To install: <br/>
`$ make install`

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging: <br/>
`$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging`

Put the sunvox library into Qmmp configDir, such as `PATH/.qmmp/sunvox.so`
